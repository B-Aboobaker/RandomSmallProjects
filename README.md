# RandomSmallProjects
This repository demonstrates the small projects that I have worked on and completed

## LotteryGame.py
### Instructions: 
- Create a lottery game application. Generate three random numbers, each between 0 and 9.  
- Allow the user to guess three numbers. 
- Compare each of the user’s guesses to the three random numbers and display a message that includes the user’s guess, the randomly determined three-digit number, and the amount of money the user has won as follows: 
- Make certain that your application accommodates repeating digits. For example, if a user guesses 1, 2, and 3, and the randomly generated digits are 1, 1, and 1, do not give the user credit for three correct guesses—just one.


## MorgansBonuses.py
### Instructions:
Morgan’s Department Store distributes bonuses to its salespeople after the holiday rush. The table below shows the bonuses, which are based on full weeks worked during the season and the number of positive online customer reviews:
|   |    0    |   1   |    2    |    3    |    4    |
|---|---------|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| 0 |  5.00   | 9.00  | 16.00   | 22.00   | 30.00   |
| 1 | 10.00   | 12.00 | 18.00   | 24.00   | 36.00   |
| 2 | 20.00   | 25.00 | 32.00   | 42.00   | 53.00   |
| 3 | 32.00   | 38.00 | 45.00   | 55.00   | 68.00   |
| 4 | 46.00   | 54.00 | 65.00   | 77.00   | 90.00   |
| 5 | 60.00   | 72.00 | 84.00   | 96.00   | 120.00  |
| 6 | 85.00   | 100.00| 120.00  | 140.00  | 175.00  |


- Making use of Multi-dimensional Arrays. Write a program that allows a user to continuously enter values for the two bonus-determining factors until they enter 999 to quit the program and displays the appropriate bonus.

## InteractiveDictionary.py
### Instructions:
I think you would agree that it is always tedious to find the meaning of a word in the dictionary, right? Hence you have been tasked to create an interactive 
dictionary using python. 
- Save 20 words (Any words of your choice) together with their meaning in a text, json or xml file. 
- Load the file in your application and allow the user to search for the saved words.  
- If the user searches for a word not part of the saved list, show an error message. 
- If the user’s word is found in the list, show the meaning of the word. 
- If the user types an invalid option, such as a number, show an appropriate error message. 
- Allow the user to search for a closest match for the word entered, if it is not found in the list. If the user selects 'No' end the program. 

## RockPaperScissors.py
### Instructions
Create a python program will help users to play rock, paper, scissors along with the computer that is designed by you. In this program, you will use a random function for generating the random output by the computer side. The user will make the first move and then the program makes one. Then a function will check the validity of the move. At last, we will display the result and ask the user to play again or not.

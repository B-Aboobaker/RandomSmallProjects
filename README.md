# RandomSmallProjects
This repository demonstrates the small projects that I have worked on and completed

## LotteryGame.py
### Instructions: 
- Create a lottery game application. Generate three random numbers, each between 0 and 9.  
- Allow the user to guess three numbers. 
- Compare each of the user’s guesses to the three random numbers and display a message that includes the user’s guess, the randomly determined three-digit number, and the amount of money the user has won as follows: 
- Make certain that your application accommodates repeating digits. For example, if a user guesses 1, 2, and 3, and the randomly generated digits are 1, 1, and 1, do not give the user credit for three correct guesses—just one.


## MorgansBonuses.py
### Instructions:
Morgan’s Department Store distributes bonuses to its salespeople after the holiday rush. The table below shows the bonuses, which are based on full weeks worked during the season and the number of positive online customer reviews:
|   |    0    |   1   |    2    |    3    |    4    |
|---|---------|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| 0 |  5.00   | 9.00  | 16.00   | 22.00   | 30.00   |
| 1 | 10.00   | 12.00 | 18.00   | 24.00   | 36.00   |
| 2 | 20.00   | 25.00 | 32.00   | 42.00   | 53.00   |
| 3 | 32.00   | 38.00 | 45.00   | 55.00   | 68.00   |
| 4 | 46.00   | 54.00 | 65.00   | 77.00   | 90.00   |
| 5 | 60.00   | 72.00 | 84.00   | 96.00   | 120.00  |
| 6 | 85.00   | 100.00| 120.00  | 140.00  | 175.00  |


- Making use of Multi-dimensional Arrays. Write a program that allows a user to continuously enter values for the two bonus-determining factors until they enter 999 to quit the program and displays the appropriate bonus.
